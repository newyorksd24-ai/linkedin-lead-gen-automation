Lead Generation and VIP Filtering System
This n8n workflow automates the ingestion, cleaning, and qualification of inbound leads via Webhook (e.g., from Postman). It processes raw data, filters out invalid entries and competitors, and automatically segments high-value clients into a VIP database.

Key Features
Webhook Ingestion: Receives bulk or single lead data via HTTP POST requests.

Data Normalization: Uses "Split Out" to handle arrays and "Set" to standardize data fields.

Multi-Stage Filtering:

Removes invalid entries via a preliminary Filter node.

Blocks competitors using a conditional logic (If node).

VIP Qualification: Routes leads based on specific criteria (Budget > Threshold AND IT Sector).

Database Integration: Automatically saves qualified VIP leads into a Google Sheet.

Workflow Logic
Webhook: Triggers the workflow with incoming JSON data.

Split Out: Separates batched data into individual items for processing.

Data Cleaning (Set): Formats fields to ensure consistency.

Filter: Basic validation to drop incomplete or malformed records.

Competitor Check (If): Excludes leads from competitor domains.

VIP Verification (If): Checks if the lead meets the high-budget and IT sector criteria.

Storage: Adds the qualified VIP lead to the Google Sheet.
